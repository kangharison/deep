## Description

i2c-nvidia-gpu is a driver for I2C controller included in NVIDIA Turing
and later GPUs and it is used to communicate with Type-C controller on GPUs.

If your `lspci -v` listing shows something like the following:

```
01:00.3 Serial bus controller [0c80]: NVIDIA Corporation Device 1ad9 (rev a1)
```

then this driver should support the I2C controller of your GPU.
